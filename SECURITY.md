## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, **please do not open a public issue**.

Instead, contact me directly:

Please include:
- A clear description of the vulnerability  
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)  
- Potential impact  
- Any suggested remediation or patches

I aim to respond within **72 hours** and provide updates on progress until the issue is resolved.

- Do not publicly share or exploit the vulnerability before it is fixed  
- Allow reasonable time for investigation and patching  
- Avoid conducting destructive testing on production environments

Thank you for helping improve the security of this project.
